Package sysproxy provides a simple interface to set/unset system-wide proxy settings.

# Platform Support

Currently this package supports desktop platforms only. The following platforms are supported:
  - macOS
  - Linux (Gnome)
  - Windows

# macOS

To configure proxy settings on macOS, we use networksetup utility with following options. To set web proxy:

	networksetup -setwebproxy <networkservice> <domain> <portnumber>

To set secure web proxy:

	networksetup -setsecurewebproxy <networkservice> <domain> <portnumber>

For more information, see the link [here].

# Linux

Currently only GNOME is supported. This package uses gsettings untility to setup proxy settings. The following commands are used to set proxy settings:

	gsetting set org.gnome.system.proxy.http host 'proxy.example.com'
	gsetting set org.gnome.system.proxy.http port 8080

The following parameters can be set for other types of proxies:

	org.gnome.system.proxy.https
	org.gnome.system.proxy.ftp
	org.gnome.system.proxy.socks

For more information, you can checkout the documentation for [gsettings] and its [configuration].

# Windows

On Windows, the package uses HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings + InternetSetOptionW
to setup proxy settings. For more information, you can checkout the documentation for [InternetSetOptionW].

# Usage

To set up system-wide proxy settings, use the [SetWebProxy] or [SetSOCKSProxy] methods to connect to a Web (HTTP & HTTPS) or SOCKS proxy.
This function takes two arguments: the IP address / hostname and the port of the proxy server.

To clear system-wide proxy settings, use the [ClearWebProxy] or [ClearSOCKSProxy] function.
This will set the address and port to "127.0.0.1:0" and disable the proxy.

To ensure that the system-wide proxy settings are unset upon program termination, it is recommended to call:

	defer ClearWebProxy()

	// or

	defer ClearSOCKSProxy()

after the setting the proxy.
